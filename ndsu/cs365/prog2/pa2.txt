To repeat what I said in class regarding problem assignment 2:  You
are to implement the 3 modules that you used in doing the first
programming assignment.  You are to show that your code for the first
assignment runs with your implementation. AND YOU ARE TO DEMONSTRATE
THAT YOUR MODULES WORK--BY PROVIDING APPROPRIATE TEST ROUTINES (TOGETHER
WITH DOCUMENTATION ON WHAT THEY ARE TESTING).  That is, you are to
convince me that your implementation does what it is supposed to do,
i.e., that it meets the specifications given in the definition module.
I will also expect from this assignment and on in this class that
you follow the style given in class for Abstract Data Types.  That
is, your implementation module should have an abstraction mapping
and a rep invariant provided for each abstraction you deal with.
Remember you may not make any changes in the definition modules
and in particular you may not recompile them.  This will demonstrate
to you that you can make changes in the implementation without the
need to recompile the rest of the program (as long as the specifications
do not change).
