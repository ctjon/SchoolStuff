The following program is a spell checker.  It will scan through a block of
text and look for words that are not in its dictionary.  If it finds such
a word it will do one of three things.

	1. write the word to the output document without changing

	2. suggest alternative words to the user

	3. add the word to the dictionary and leave the document unchanged

YOU MUST TRAIN THIS SPELL CHECKER!!!!  it will not be very smart the
first time you run it.
