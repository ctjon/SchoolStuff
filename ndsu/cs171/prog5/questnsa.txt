QUESTION #22   PAGE 310
        
A: The first player does not necessarily have a forced win.  The victor 
   will be deterimined through a combination of factors.  If the number
   of piles is even and there is a pile with a single chip then the first
   player will win if he choses to remove the pile with more than one 
   chip.  If there is no pile with a single chip then the first player
   can win if he removes all but two chips from a pile.  This could 
   cause the second player to remove a whole pile thus leaving two 
   chips.  Then the first player could remove one chip leaving one left
   for the second player.  (first player wins)  The second player could
   however remove a whole pile save two chips.  This would force the 
   first player to remove one or two.  If he removes one then the second
   player can remove two and win.  If he removes two then the second
   player can remove one and win.  Thus it would become clear that the
   winner can only be determined by the number of chips and the number
   of piles.  If the number of piles is greater than one and there is
   more than one chip in all piles then the winner will only be determined
   by the players reactions to each others moves.  In the special cases
   where there is only one pile or there is a pile with only a single
   chip the first player can force a win by removing all but one chip
   from the board.

C: AN ALGORITHM TO REMOVE SYMETRIC SYBLINGS COULD BE DONE AS FOLLOWS:

   DETERMINE THE CHILDREN OF A NODE
   CHECK TO SEE IF THEY EXIST ELSEWHERE IN THE TREE
   IF SO DO NOT CREATE NEW NODE FOR CHILD RATHER SET POINTER TO CHILD TO
       NODE WHICH ALREADY EXISTS
   OTHERWISE CREATE THE NODE
