RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ASKED IN THE PROBLEM ASSIGNMENT
Page 258 #23


In addressing the question of the elimination of infrequently
occuring words I think that to eliminate infrequently occuring
words would me a mistake since the majority of important words
may only occur once.  The types of words which should be
eliminated should include prepositions and non-significant nouns.
A way in which this could be accomplished is to keep two
dictionaries.  One would hold insignificant words and the other
would hold significant words.  A check could then be done to
determine if the words are significant or not.  If a word is not
found in either dictionary the user could be prompted and asked
which one it should be stored in.  This process should be done
as the block of text is read so as to gain maximum effeciency in
use of memory.
