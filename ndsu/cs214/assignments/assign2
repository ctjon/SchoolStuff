  PROGRAM 2       DUE: On or before Friday Apr. 6, 1990 at 5 PM

  Write  a  program to take a C program as input and substitute different key
  words for all its reserved words.  Be sure not to change any reserved words
  which occur in comments or in quoted text.  You must demonstrate that  this
  has been accomplished.

  INPUT FILE

  One  line  for  each  keyword.   First the keyword  then one or more blanks
  followed by the word to be substituted.  The last line of these words is to
  be followed by a line containing just the character '$'.  This is  then  to
  be followed by the program.  e.g.

     int     integer
     if      ifyouwantto
     for     because
     $
     main()
     {         /* Be sure to check comments containing int don't change */
       int i;
       for (i=0,i < 26,i++) if(i == 2) printf("for what if %d n",i);
     }

  PROGRAM NOTES

  For  this  program it is enough to show that your program can convert about
  10 distinct C keywords into your 'new language'.  Use a small  but  through
  test set (say about 10 to 20 lines of selected C).
