        ASSIGNMENT: Program 1

        Write  a  program  that  processes  the  following  commands (the
        command is designated by a number).

          0.  exit program

          1.  read a list of up to 100 integers.  The values are preceded
             by the number of integers in the set.

          2.  display the list sorted in order largest to smallest

          3.  display the list sorted in order smallest to largest

          4.  display the average of the values

          5.  list the values in current order each followed by how  much
             it differs from average.

        Programming note:

        A  good  way to write this program is to write and debug the main
        routine calling stubs.  A stub is routine that does no processing
        but just lists the message 'stub for routine xxx'.

	NOTE: Be sure to read the file "complete" in this directory which
	tells what must be turned into the grader for a complete program.
