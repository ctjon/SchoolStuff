  PROGRAM 3       DUE: On or before Friday Apr. 20, 1990 at 5 PM

  This  program  will  build and manage a binary sorted tree.  There are four
  commands: ADD, PRINT, DEL and INIT.  The command name starts in column  one
  and is followed by one blank.

     1. The command INIT will initialize the tree to empty.

     2.  The  command  PRINT  will  print out the entire tree in alphabetical
        order.

     3. The command ADD will cause a new node to be entered  into  the  tree.
        The  value  for  the node is the text (up to 80 characters) after the
        command and its following blank.  This value will be  placed  in  the
        tree at the correct point.  For any node, if the given value precedes
        the  node's  value the value is to be placed in the left subtree.  If
        the value follows (or is equal) it is  to  be  placed  in  the  right
        subtree.

     4.  The command DEL will find the first occurrence in the tree of a line
        starting the same as the text following the command and its blank and
        delete that node from the tree.  It may be necessary to  rebuild  the
        tree to delete the node.

  You are to use recursive routines for all of the commands.
