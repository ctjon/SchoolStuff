        Homework #2: due at class time on Wednesday, Feb. 2, 1994

        Compile  and  run inettime as shown in chapter 10 of the text and
        as  found   in   /keeper/doc/networking/netprog/inettime.    This
        program  collects two kinds of time from a server, using both TCP
        and UDP.  As written, the code aborts as soon as a  server  fails
        to  properly handle its request, often failing to try other forms
        of the request which would have succeeded.  In  particular,  this
        happens  with  vm1.nodak.edu.   Fix  this  problem, and any other
        problems you may find.  Also,  make  sure  the  output  from  the
        program  is  explicit  in  identifying  what problem arose from a
        particular request.  Be sure to document exactly what you had  to
        do  to  libraries and code to get the program to compile and work
        properly.  This is to simulate what you would have to do  on  the
        job  to  document  for  the  next  systems  jock how you modified
        things.  Test inettime on a number of kinds of servers  (such  as
        Solbourne, Sun, IBM mainframe, AT&T 3B2, HP 300, AS400, etc.)
