        Homework #3: due at class time on Wednesday, Feb. 9, 1994

        You  are to implement UDP ping (the protocol name is "echo").  To
        get something working quickly you can modify either the UDP  time
        or  daytime  routine  from  chapter  10, being sure to send out a
        different sequence number in each packet.  The reason we are  not
        doing  the  ping  in  chapter 11 is that ICMP ping requires a raw
        socket to be opened, and this cannot be done without being  super
        user  (or using setuid).  To see this, look at the permissions on
        /etc/ping, the system's ICMP ping program.  We will try ICMP ping
        on our Pentium cluster when we and it are ready.

        UDP ping works on Sun's, Solbourne's and  Next's.   Be  sure  and
        make  your  UDP  ping  provide the similar output to the standard
        ICMP ping (see sample output on page 459 of the text  and/or  run
        /etc/ping).    Also,   be   sure  that  any  host  that  "refuses
        connection" causes a reasonable message to be  printed  and  does
        NOT abort and cause a core dump.
