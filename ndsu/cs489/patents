Basic Principles of Patent Protection for Computer Software
 J. M. Jakes & E.R. Yoches

  US Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power

   "To promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for
   a limited time to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their
   respective writings and discoveries."



PATENT PROTECTION (copyrights in paper 22, both discussed in text also)

 - for many years software was considered unpatentable
    by US Patent & Trademark Office

      - fell within "unpatentable subject matter
          - methods of doing business
          - processes involving human judgment
          - arrangements of printed matter

      - at one time USP&T considered programs merely algorithms
        or "principles of nature".  Rejected apps on that basis.

      - after long battle and uncertainty (1960s & 1970s)


      - Supreme Court settled issue in favor of patentability
        (1981 Diamond v. Diehr)

             "Process that would otherwise be patentable would not
              become unpatentable just because it is executed by computer."

      - Software patents still slow to catch on

      - Now there are many patented programs and patent applications

      - still some confusion about what patents can protect.



TECHNICALLY:  Computer programs are NOT patentable

  - this is misleading

  - programs themselves are not patentable, but

  - computers operated by programs are patentable.
    (Programmed computers are MACHINES implementing PROCESSES (both patentable)

  - program that seem unpatentable, may be if properly claimed



PATENT CLAIMS = portion of patent which defines the invention (at end of patent)

   - in order to get patent, CLAIM must be on proper subject matter (patentable)

   - claims that recite math algorithms purely - not patentable

   - operation of computer or human performing same steps - unpatentable
     (mental steps doctrine: can't patent mental steps)

   - software containing "methods of doing business" unpatentable.

   - to avoid claiming unpatentable subject matter - claim should define
     invention in terms of physical elements such as found in computer.
     Usually possible to do.

   - Claim with proper subject matter (patentable) does not guarantee patent.



NOVELTY REQUIREMENTS

   - patentable subject matter must be novel.

   - Novelty means no item of "prior art" can contain EVERY element of claim

   - Prior art includes patents and pubs dated 1 year prior to filing,
     public uses or sales or offers for sale in US >= 1 year prior to filing.

   - If patent app not filed <= 1 year of first offer for sale, may loose rights



UNOBVIOUSNESS REQUIREMENTS

   - patentable subject matter must be unobvious.

   - tough call (unobvious to whom???)

   - objective tests used (commercial success?...)



ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE

   - Patentable subject matter, which is novel and unobvious must be
     properly disclosed (described)
  
   - Thus, can't keep best ideas as trade secrets and still get a patent.

   - Must actual code be disclosed??

      - In general, flowcharts, block diagrams.. are acceptable (preferred?)



AMENDING a REJECTED APPLICATION

When rejected, a patent may be AMENDED as long as no new matter is included.



APPEALING AFTER REJECTION OF AMENDED APPLICATION

When amended applic is rejected, can appeal to Patent & Trademark Office.



PATENT PENDING

   - kept secret by P&TO while pending



MAINTENANCE OF PATENT, ONCE OBTAINED

   - must pay maintenance fees

   - can last up to 17 years (must pay maintenance fees)

   - when patent expires, subject matter becomes public domain



EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS PROVIDED

   - like a copyright, owner has exclusive rights

   - exclude all others from making, using or selling invention

   - patent stronger than copyright

      - patent infringed even if not copying or KNOWLEDGE of patent by infringer

   - infringement can be established even for "partial infringement"

   - infringement can be established even for "equivalence of function"

      - recent user-interface cases involving "same look and feel"



TO PATENT OR NOT TO PATENT?

   - practical considerations usually outweigh legal

   - very expensive process

   - long duration process

   - infringement proof difficult and expensive

   - some claim patents stifle innovation and creativity

   - some believe patents encourage innovation and creativity
