What salary level would be adequate to induce you to take a parttime job
within the department as a co-advisor (see below)?  ___________________




                 NDSU Computing Majors Co-Advisor Program
                 ----------------------------------------

Goals:  improve advising function (help dedicated students determine and
				   achieve there academic goals)
	provide high-paying,interest-area-based, work-study opportunities
	increase retention in computing majors (B.S. in C.S., B.A. in C.S.,
				     M.I.S. in Bus., Comp. Eng. in EEE, others?)
	improve student tracking
		encourage "hometown" mentoring groups
		improve deparmental alumae record keeping
		provide additional placement paths


Method:
	Student co-advisors would be hired and paired with newer students
	in the same degree track, with the same general academic goals, and,
	where possible, from the same hometown or area, to co-advise on
	curricular matters, options available, relative importance of various
	courses and subject areas, available resources (location of computers,
	tutoring on use, ...) and offer support and encouragement.

	Co-advisors would work closely with faculty advisor (attend initial
	meeting between student and advisor each term, stay in touch with
	both student and advisor throughout the quarter via personal meetings,
	email, phone,... advise on such matters as Student ACM club membership,
	department and college social functions,...)

	Function as ombudsman and intermediary for student (help remove
	misunderstandings, promote communication),

Discussion:
Student co-advisors would be particularly important when the student reaches
a decision point (e.g., to change majors...) that decision can benefit from
the wisdom and advise of one who has been there recently.  For example,
some students find that they are not cut out for the B.S. degree as presently
structured, but do not consider the B.A. degree alternative.  Other students
become interested in M.I.S. or Comp.Eng. or vice versa.  These students
would be sent to a co-advisor from the prospective destination program
for information and advice.  Whenever possible students who are changing
degree tracks would be switched to co-advisors who have recently made a
similar change.
