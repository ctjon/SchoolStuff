TRADE SECRETS (From the text)

US Government allows companies to protect trade secrets by requiring
the signing of NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS.

  - Disclosure is a crime and can be prosecuted.

  - Once disclosed, however, the secret looses its trade secret status and
    others are free to use it.

  - No expiration data for protection

  - Example is Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe of 11 herbs and spices.

  - Protection can be invoked without filing anything with US government
