   Work within a structure

   Labor Union :
     - is union still serving its purposes ?
     - should worker performs at top level or at union level ?
     - is a union a help in the decision to fire or retain a worker ?
     - pros and cons of union.

   Famous entrepreneurs :
     - Sam Walton	Walmart
     - Semour Cray	Cray Computers
     - Steve Jobs	Apple/NeXT
     - Bill Gates	MicroSoft
     - Mitch Kapoor	Lotus
     - Bill Joy		Sun Microsystems

    Any one can do it in the computing industry.  Most of these people started
    in their basements or garages (figuratively) and went on to be millionare
    leaders in the industry.  Each of these people actually produced the
    winning product or killer idea (at least initially).
    They were not just "management" of a successful company.

    Why does Sam Walton head the list
    (why is he even on this computer-genius-list?)?
      - his killer idea, on which he built his company and became america's
        richest man, was Computerized Precision Sales and User Freindliness.
      - Walmart is so successful because they are "user freindly"
        (a greeter at every door, checkouts say your name or you get a free...)
        and they have mastered the science (computer or database science) of
		 the right products,
		 at the right place,
        	 in the right quantities,
		 at the right time.

CHANGE  (Observation of differences over time)
------  

Evolutionary  -  Revolutionary  -  Catastrophic

As functions:
  Evolution & revolution are continuous changes over time
     (usually smooth - differentiable)

           change
evolution   ^      /
            |     /

SHAKE UP these ideas.
--------------------

What is the x-axis here (basic time-axis)?
     It is "time" as measured or metered by the wall clock.

The whole analysis of change is based on our acceptance of certain premises
     (which aren't necessarily true!)

Baseline in our analysis and quantification of change is "time" line.
If I glance at the clock 3 times:

      ^
      |
      |
      *-->      *-->-->    <----*-->
      3:00      3:15            3:45

I "know" twice as much time has elapsed in the second interval as in the first.
(twice as much time change has occurred.)

There are at least two problems with this:
1.  Whose clock is right? (are all clocks synchronized as to speed and setting?)
     - can it be done?
     - in order to synchronize two clocks, you have to take your eyes off one
       and focus on the other - time will elapse in the process.

     The North Star Clock project assumed it could be done (place a
     geo-stationary satellite in the shape of a big-hand and little-hand
     which always shows correct gmt time to the northern hemisphere (northern
     hemisphere prejudice?).

     Defining a consistent global clock in distributed database systems is
     impossible, if we rely on wall clock notions only.

2.  Does time really elapse when no change takes place? (i.e., does time really
    "march on" no matter what is changing, if anything?)

    - suppose all change shutdown for a period.  Would time elapse in that
      period (wall clock would tell you NO).  How much time would elapse?

    - If you did sleep (I know, students don't sleep), would time elapse?
      We are conditioned to assume time has elapsed (by looking at the clock).
      This denies your instincts which tell you time has not elapsed (assuming
      you have not just had a rememberable (maybe even memorable) dream -
      which could get us off into another interesting direction - are dreams
      real?  if not are you dreaming now?   but this would be too much of
      a digresioin)

    - If a newborn were put in a Skinner box for 20 years and not given any
      evidence and instruction that change occurs while sleeping, would that
      person ever really believe time elapses during sleep?  I don't think so.

    - A study was done in which a person (voluntarily) lived in a large
underground sealed capsule for extended periods of time and was ask to record
her guesses as to the hour ticks.  After 3 months, what she thought was a
day was actually 3 days.  There was very little change in the capsule so there
seemed to be less elapsing of time.  


Leads us (in a rough sort of way) to the whole idea of MODELING.

Models (frameworks with which to analyze, study, investigate and/or predict)
come in three categories:

experimental (Chemists, Biologists, ...)
theoretical (Mathematicians, other_propellor-heads,..)
computorial  (Simulators, programmers, us..)

experimentalists use real inputs to their system and real apparati.
theoreticians use mathematical formulas and numerical or representational inputs
computiacs use simulated inputs, programs and simulations as apparati.

BOTTOM-LINE on Modeling:
Correct, valid models are not to be judged as right/wrong.  Models are either
convenient/inconvenient, adequate/inadequate to explain, analyze, evaluate
and/or predict change

SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS:  Never judge a model as right or wrong (and don't let
others judge your models as right or wrong).  They can, of course, be
internally correct/incorrect (faulty or not, error_free or not), but error_free
models are never wrong!  They can also be invalid for a particular user,
in the sense that the assumptions made in the model run counter to
the experience of the user.  But if they are internally correct and valid, they
still may not detailed enough or sophisticated enough
to predict, explain, evaluate, or analyze to the degree required. Then a new and
more detailed model is needed.  That doesn't make the old model wrong, just
inoperable for the purpose at hand.

Now, with respect to quantification (think grading), the Yes/no
decision that represents the output of your model may not be adequate
for the purpose, it is correct, provided your model is error_free and valid.

It is legitimate to argue that an more sophisticated model is needed,
but not that the model is wrong.
For instance, grading as we know it (or hiring, or promotion, or
any other quantification-produced binary decision) may well need to be
replaced some day, but certainly not with a "let it all hang out" less
sophisticated "flower child" method-less method of making a decision that
needs to be made.  Opps!  That was my one editorialization.  It is my
opinion only.  It is directed at those who would say that grades must
go (no-one in the class has yet defended that point of view).
 

Incidentally...
   Catastrophe is discontinuous change (no predictable relationship between
     input and output)  (e.g., stock market crash)

           change

Calculus and math analysis handle
	 evolution i(low sloped curves) and
	 revolution (high slope curves)

Until 20 years ago, it was thought that mathematics couldn't be used to analyze
catastrophes (except for some "singularity analysis" techniques, which made a
small attempt).

Then came CATASTROPHE THEORY (mathematical theory of catastrophes).
                                                 3
     Assuming that all change is "reasonable"  (C  meaning continuous 3rd
     derivatives) even catastrophes can be analyzed and categorized.  I.e.,
     there are only a few ways in which catastrophes can occur.

For example, assuming dogs attack or flee depending on only one input parameter
(size of opponent) and that nothing else matters, then the only way this
catastrophe can occur (dog changes catastropically from flight to attack) is the
"fold catastrophe model":

attack      ^
            |  -.
            |    `-.
    ^       |       `-.
    |       |          `.
aggression  |           |
dimension   |        .-'
    |       |small .'               big
    v       |------|------------------->  opponent's size dimension
            |       `-.
            |          `-.
            |             `-.
            |                `-.
flight      |                   `-.


This model may not be sophisticated enough to suit.  E.I, it may be the case
that you think aggression is modeled better  by a combination of dog-fear and
dog-rage than by just opponent size.  you would want a more sophisticated model.
(that is, you think that using opponent-size along is likely to give you
results which are inconvenient, such as an unpredicted dog bite).
                   -----------

This doesn't mean that the first model is wrong!  It means only that the first
model was inconvenient for the purpose (e.g., avoiding a dog bite 80% of the
time).  Presumably, if you were big enough, your size would guarantee 
that fear dominates rage in the dog and the first model would suffice, but if
your are average size or if the dog is a pit bull, maybe not.

Then you must go to a more convenient model, e.g., one which assumes two input
parameters (fear=ears_back and rage=teeth_bared) which depend on the
dog and are observable.

This gives the "cusp catastrophe".

STOCK MARKET CRASH


One model is that the rate of change in the price index (rcpi) is dependent on
the amount of demand.  In that case a stock market crash is a fold catastrophe:


            ^
            |  -.
            |    `-.
    ^       |       `-.
    |       |          `.
   rcpi     | crash     |
    |       |     \  .-'
    |       |      .'             large
    v       |------|------------------->  demand
            |       `-.
            |          `-.
            |             `-.
            |                `-.
            |                   `-.


With this model you may fail to predict a crash or predict a phantom crash
(one which doesn't occur).  If you are just an observer, missing it a little
may be no big deal, but if you are a broker or major investor, it is important.
So you may want to include "speculation" as an input parameter.  (the above
model sort of assumes constant speculation levels - albeit, quite high).

Then your model is a cusp catastrophe:

               .-----------------.  <- - low speculation (evolutoinary change)
            ^  |                 |
            |  -.       .        |  <- - medium spec (revolutionary change)
            |    `-.    .        |
    ^       |       `-. .        |
    |       |        . `.        |
  rcpi      |       .   :        |  <- - high spec (catastrophic change)
    |       |      . .-'         |
    |       |      .'            |
    v       |      :             |
            |       `-.          |
            |          `-.       |
            |             `-.    |
            |                `-._|
            v
                     .- - - - - - - - -> demand
                    / 
                   / 
                  /
                 /
                /
               V
          Speculation


This is an interesting model since the speculation parameter really governs
whether the change function is

 evolutionary (low speculation - toward the back of the response surface;

 revolutionary (middle depths); or

 catastrophic (front of surface).
