After today's discussion, I have decided to put a large file called "security"
in the library for your use.  It is a long set of notes on mandatory security
issues.  It includes a more detailed discussion of what was presented in
class today, together with volumes of additional detail.  The citations from
which the material were taken are given also (for your convenient reference).

As you can see, I miss-spoke.  I said "no system today is C2!"  What I meant
to say is "no system today is B1!".  Apologies to Chris.
Thanks
