Carpol's Syndrome is real!  Carpol's Syndrome involves the wrists and
fingers of a programmer (blue hands disease) in which the programmer experiences
pain and numbness in the hand and fingers.  The condition is brought on by
inflammation of the tendons in the palm and wrist due to constant pressure from
placing wrists flat on a table while keyboarding.  It can be very severe.

In fact, a graduate student at NDSU (also a faculty member at Mankato State)
just completed surgery on one hand for this problem.  So it is real!


Are LCD and Gas Plasma screens safer for eyes than CRTs?

Human input/output bandwidth is the true bottleneck in computing today.
Keyboards are slow.
Even the soon-to-be-reality voice-recognition-speach-synthesis
systems will fail to provide high bandwidth for communication between human
and computer system.


WHAT CAN BE DONE TO RAISE THE HUMAN-TO-COMPUTER BANDWIDTH???????

What about skates (foot operated mouses)?
   - they free up your hands for keyboard-only use.

What about the Knee-track-pad?
   - Sort of a mouse which attaches to the top of your knee and which you
     roll along the underside of your desk).
 
For really high bandwith and to be fully Cybernetic and "in touch" with
your workstation, how about the following futuristic scenario:

1.  two skates (or as many as you have feet) with 5 puddy-proof-toe-buttons
    on each.

2.  two knee-track-pads (customized with "buttons" for those with trick knees).
      or (for those who prefer to stand - we aim to please!)
    one rear-pad (can be rolled against the wall behind you like a mouse -
    lower bandwidth than the dual ktp's (especially since only one
    full-foot-skate and a lower bandwidth heel-on-the-floor-metatarsal-skate)
    could be used in conjunction with it).

3.  one keyboard (but a Keyboard in which each finger is inserted into
    a tube which is sensitive at 4 (or more?) points, top, bottom, left-side,
    right-side.  Each 5-tube unit (one for left hand and one for right hand)
    can be lifted-lowered-moved_left-moved_right-moved_forward-moved_backward,
    adding 25% to the input bandwidth.
    This "arm movement dimension would be effected using rings
    around the wrists so as not to cancel effective concurrent fingers use).

4.  voice recognition device

5.  speech generation capability

6.  Head-pen (a light-pen or stylus hooked to your cap which interfaces through
    light sensitivity or touch to the screen in front of you - blinking you
    eye triggers a mouse-button (fine wire attached to your eyelid, attached
    in a manner similar to false eyelashes).  Maybe even two buttons, one
    hooked to your left eyelid and the other to your right eyelid)

7.  Four torso-bump buttons (left shoulder to "push" left-button, right shoulder
    for right-button, chest for forward-button and back for back-button).

Try to imagine the worker productivity increase that could be realized by
a well trained person with this Fully-Cybernetic Perrizo-Control-System (PerCS)
User Interface.  You could whip out a programming assignment in a matter
of seconds!  Training would be a problem!  But, I'd start with those talented
one-person-band musicians who play the squeeze-box, harmonica and full set of
drums all at the same time, jugglers, high-wire artists, Failed-S&L-execs (they
juggle several sets of books pretty well, AND they're looking for work!)....

Have I captured maximum input bandwidth here?  Keep in mind I am reserving the
eyes as exclusively acknowledgment devices (user observes on screen
acknowledgements of all other input channels, and, thereby monitors the whole
process).

I see this thing as follows:
I am a manager.  I want high level information (knowledge, decision) from my
system.  I hire two types of people:

1.  Input professionals (the wriggling masses who sit before this PerCS device
    an enter data, commands, ...

2.  System developers (who use a PerCS also, but to develop the code to make
    it an efficient KBMS, DSS).

I am the output user.  Thus, output bandwidth is not so important.  I just want
nice high-level yes/no type decision support answers.  As input I use which
ever method I choose (probably voice recognition).

This would really produce "computerized leisure" as discussed
in the text, chapter 5!!!!

Is there a down side to this sort of system in terms of users?
    - would it be user-friendly?  Is that important?


Privacy, security and information flow:

Information and data flow in several ways.

Overt information flow = intentional information flow (from producer to
consumer or info-customer).

   - here we WANT info to be transferred and the game it to maximize information
     flow (what most DBMSs, MISs, KBMSs, and DSSs are all about).

The other side of the coin:

Covert information flows or (cover channels) = unwanted information flows
(unwanted by the legit producer-manager-users of the raw data, anyway

    - example is a spy on military data.

    - another example is industrial espionage - one company stealing secrets
      from another)

    - There is a whole industry growing up with the intent to "keep"
      information from unauthorized users or customers.

There is discretionary security and mandatory security.  In mandatory security
all users have "security classifications" such as Unclassified, Confidential,
Secret, Top Secret.  All data is classified, usually along the same lines
(U, C, S, T).  It is the job of a MultiLevel Secure Database Management System
to police this system in terms of security.

A MLS-DBMS is usually built using the Bell-Lapadula model:

1. You can read down

2. You can write up

This guarantees multilevel security.


Covert Channels:

Example:  File existence storage channel.

Secret users wants to transmit Morse code message to Unclassified user
without leaving a detectable trail (so he doesn't go to jail for it).

S: waits for signal from U (U can write up)

S: If bit to transmit is "1", create file F.
   else delete F

C: send signal

C: sleep(1)

C: open F

C: If "Your not allowed to access!" hear "1"
   else hear "0".


In Chapters 4 and 5, there is considerable discussion of the negative
impacts of computers on users and societies.  The points made and implied
are very valid and I don't disagree with them, but I would offer a companion
thought to keep in mind when considering them.  Do you agree or disagree with
this position?

Stress, pain, depression, ....  can be somewhat attitudinal.  Ones attitute
can "control" these other factors to a substantial extent.  Most people
can control the negative results of stress and can control depression through
attitude.  There may be "clinical" cases, however.

The following anecdote is offered to illustrate the point that most of us
can "decide" not to be negative or depressed, if we choose to.


A person checked into an expensive hotel in a large eastern city.  Our person
was very tired and needed to rest up for an important meeting the next day.
After a hot bath, our person went to bed and fell right to sleep, only to
be awoken an hour later by a piano playing in the next room.  Our person was
irate!  The manager was immediately consulted, but there were no other open
rooms.  Our person ranted and raved at the management for about an hour and
finally attempted to force the point by asking very sarcastically "Who is the
person in the next room??  A more important customer than I am???"  The manager
replied that it was the great Paterouski and he was practicing for his
very important performance the next day.  They just couldn't disturb him.

Our person immediately turned and went back to the room.

Later a guest check out earlier than expected and the management
immediately came to our persons's room with the good news that a move was now
possible and that they would do it without delay.  Management knocked on
the door ... there was no answer.  After several knocks, management used a
pass key - intending to have our person moved upon returning.  When they openned
the door, they found our person and several friends that had been called
in rapt silence, listenning to the great Paterouski play.

A change in attitude.


A related point regarding confort levels:
It seems to be taken for granted that increased confort and reduced labor
are positives.  That may not always be the case.  We may not always improve
productivity and happiness through technology advances.  A couple of cases
are:

1.  In a department on campus (will remain anonymous - not CS though), there
has been a revolution in office technology.  Most of the members have taken
to computers and other advanced office machines completely (wysiwyg work
processors, ...), but one has not.  This one person still sits in front of
an old IBM selectric typewriter to type complicated formulas by overwriting
etc.  This person is by far the most prolific publisher of new ideas in the
department!

2.  On a recent vacation to the jungle area of the Yucatan penisula, I had
the chance to ovserve the Mayan people living in their ancient thached roofed
stick huts without floors or running water.  They appeared to be very happy.
There appeared to be universal harmony in their society.  Even their dogs
were different.  I never heard one of them bark and they never comfronted
strangers in the territorial way that our dogs do.  The people work hard, get
a lot done in a day, and are always happy.  I observed one girl who stood at
the checkout of the one store for 14 hours a day and never lost her cheerful
attitude.

It seem the government has decided this must change.  They are building concrete
appartments for these people.  The people are refusing to move in!  In fact,
many are saving up their money to build replica huts far back in the jungle,
just in case the government forces them to abandon their present ones.

I was struck by the realization that technology advances may not always be
positive.
