                          IN
           COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE



Biases:

     Gender Bias

       DO YOU THINK GENDER BIAS EXISTS?

       DO YOU THINK GENDER BIAS EXISTS IN COMPUTING AND INFORMATION MGMT?

       -What about nursing?,

                   construction?,

                   teaching (K-6?, 7-12, higher Ed?)?

                   professional sports?,

                   university sports?.

                   home economics?,

                   computing and information mgmt?

                   other?


        ISSUES:

          salary inequity

               - result of seniority deficit?

               - time-in-place deficit?

               - "Same-pay-for-same-work" principle

                    - is it universal?

                    - should it be universal?

          a majority minority

               - what can a majority do to eliminate minority treatment?

               - entrepeneurialism in our industries
                 (computing and information management)

                    - can it be used to offset or ameliorate bias?


          sexual harassment:

               - is it a problem at universities?

               - is it a problem in this community?

               - is it a problem in computing and information mgmt?

          sexual orientation:

               - do you believe it is a choice or a genetic factor?

               - is there a moral issue?

               - How many orientations are there?

                   - today there appear to be 2 (homo and hetero)

                   - 20 years ago there was one (hetero - homo was considered
                                                          to be deviation)

                   - in 20 years will there be others?

               - to what extent are our ethical principles the result of
                 pressures.

               - is it an important issue in computing and information mgmt?

                    - impersonal nature of our industries
                      (computing and information management)

                    - physical isolation in our industries
                      (computing and information management)

                    - lack of social contact in our industries
                      (computing and information management)

          parity and equity laws:

               - should there be hiring quotas at all?

               - should there be hiring quotas based for gender?

               - should there be hiring quotas for sexual orientation?



     Ethnic Bias  (race, color, creed)

       DO YOU THINK ETHNIC BIAS EXISTS?

       DO YOU THINK ETHNIC BIAS EXISTS IN COMPUTING AND INFORMATION MGMT?

                    - does our industry have a special obligation here?

                         - we can accommodate handicap more easily than others.

          parity and equity laws:

               - should there be hiring quotas based for the handicapped?


Editorial:
---------

We all must have at least two codes of ethics, personal and societal (we are
members of society and therefore have some responsibility for societal ethics).

Both codes of ethics should be developed based on principles, not personalities;
                                                 intellect, not emotion;
                                                 informed opinion (study masters
                                                  - philosophers, theologians..)

If you don't develop you own code of personal ethics, someone else will be glad
to do it for you

If we, as members of our society, don't develop our own code of ethics, pressure
groups will be glad to do it for us.  ARE THEY?

Cases to consider:

1.  School children are knitting blankets for the "homeless".  Are these
    blankets going to the YWCA Rape and Abuse Crisis Center or to
    FM Churches United For the Homeless Mission?  What's the difference?

    Are those at YWCA RACC there because they have no means of providing a
    real home for themselves and their children which is free from abuse?

    Are many of those at FM CUFH there because they choose to be?

    Which group is currently more "in the news"?  Do we shift our societal
    ethics depending on popularity  and pressure? (emotion-based criteria).

2.  Let us note that the societal ethics issues which dominate are those for
    which there is a vocal and strong advocacy group (Can we therefore conclude
    that our code of societal ethics is driven by fear (of consequences and
    discomfort)?).

    Gender biases (NOW groups and others)
    Sexual orientation biases (ACTUP and others)
    Color and ethnic biases (many, many groups)

    What about those segments of our society that CANNOT pressure us?
        - children
        - new born
        - unborn
        - very elderly (too old to remember if they are members of AARP)
    
3.  This is just an attempt to show that. possibly, our society gives
    in to pressure in forming ethical standards (fear driven decision - emotion
    not intellect).

    If Homosexual partners were given full rights as married couples, would they
    be allowed to adapt children?  One could argue (and many do) that a gay
    couple can parent as well as any other couple.

    Any unwed mother, no matter what her age, usually has the right to be a
    single parent if she chooses to be.  Society seems to hold that a newborn
    is the property of the mother.  Is that fair to the child?

    What about the children in these 2 cases?  They CANNOT
    pressure us.  As a parent, I know that parenting is one
    of the most complex and difficult of human tasks.  As a former child, I
    know that children only know what they have experienced.  They are unable
    or less able to know what they have no opportunity to experience and
    therefore are much less able to know when they are being deprived of their
    "rights" or unfairly treated.  Since very young children CANNOT demand
    their rights, does our society fail to consider their rights in its code
    of ethics?  Is our societal code of ethics formed by emotion or intellect?

    The very old also rely on others to demand their rights, for the most part.
    Does our society fail to consider their rights in its code of ethics?
    Have you been to a retirement home during a meal time?  How are they
    treated?

    The unborn certainly have not means of demanding their rights.  Do they have
    any?  If so, does society ignore them in the face of pressure?

ONCE AGAIN, IF WE DON'T FORM OUR PERSONAL AND SOCIETAL CODES OF ETHICS BASED
ON INTELLECT, PRINCIPLES AND INFORMED OPINION, SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE MORE THAN
HAPPY TO FORM THOSE CODES FOR US!!!!
