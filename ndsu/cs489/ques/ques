          Chapter1: Information, Society, and Technology
                                 
                                 
                    3 Exam Questions and Answers
                                 


     1) Briefly discuss/define the terms data, information, and
          knowledge.

          Answer:
               Data are specific numerical or symbolic
          representations of "facts" about the world. Data are
          the elements to be input, stored and manipulated by the
          computer.

               Information is a useful organization and selection
          of facts. Information is a structural characteristic of
          data because it involves relationships among the
          represented facts. More data does not necessarily mean
          more information (only if it is organized in a useful
          manner).

               Knowledge involves evaluating and understanding
          information. It refers to the meaning of information
          with respect to human interests and purposes. Data can
          be organized into useful information; but, in order for
          this information to be able to contribute to our
          knowledge, it must be of interest or value to us.      
           

     2) What it meant by the term " the two cultures" which was
          introduced by C.P. Snow? 

          a) describes the twentieth-century split between
             seeking knowledge through scientific inquiry and
             through religion, the arts, and the humanities

          b) the world is neatly divided into two, and only two
             cultures

          c) when the two cultures merge, we find people who
             are intrigued by both the "how" and the "why" of
             the universe 

          d) All of the above

          e) Only answers a) and c) are correct

               Answer: 
                  Choice e) Only answers a) and c) are correct
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
     3) Which of the following is/are true about a system?

          a) a system has a boundary that separates what is being
             analyzed from the rest of the world

          b) the function of a system is a description of what it
             does
     
          c) the way the system interacts with its environment is
             described by its input/output characteristics

          d) All of the above are true

          e) Only a) and c) are true


               Answer: 
                  Choice d) All of the above are true

                    Choice c) Revolutions; Evolutions



     2) Which of the following statements are true about the
          Industrial Revolution?

          a) During the industrial revolution human labor was
               freed from the social restrictions of feudalism.

          b) As capitalism arose from the industrial revolution,
               work for wages became a social and economic
               necessity.

          c) The industrial revolution transformed
               particularistic social relationships into
               universalistic ones which helped make possible the
               coordination of many strangers into new production
               processes and social structures.

          d) All of the Above (are True)

               Answer:
                    Choice d) All of the Above






     3) Which of the following statements about "Information, 
          Property, and Power in History" are false?

          a) Today the term Luddite is used to refer to senseless
               violence against technology, but the original
               Luddites attacked machines only in the factories
               where they were put out of work (in a futile
               attempt to halt industrialization).

          b) During the rise of capitalism, land and human labor
               were socially redefined as being "for sale"; in
               addition, commodities, which are made to be sold
               for profit using rationally organized wade labor,
               became prevalent. 

          c) Although "information" was gradually freed from
               traditional constraints during the rise of
               capitalism, it did not generally become private
               property:  Modern information became a new
               collective property. 

          d) In non-industrial societies, work is interwined with
               other pursuits of life. Most people did not work
               for wages, but out of obligations to friends and
               relatives.  People exchanged the products of their
               work as gifts or through barter.
     
          e) None of the Above (are False)


               Answer:
                    Choice e) None of the Above

                   3 Exam Questions and Answers


     1) Which of the following statements is true about
          Telecommuting?

          a) Telecommuting is an arrangement of work in which
               employees are geographically scattered;
               coordination and control functions are performed
               by computer network.

          b) Most telecommuting arrangements are between
               companies and their geographically dispersed
               subsidiaries, suppliers, and subcontractors.

          c) Most telecommuting arrangements are between offices
               and individuals.

          d) Answers a)  and  b)  are True

          e) All of the Above are True


               Answer:
                    Choice d) Answers a)  and  b)  are True



     2) Computers have made a tremendous impact on the
          transformation of work -- including the alienation and
          automation of the of the labor force.  Which of the
          following statements is/are true about office     
          automation and it's social consequences?

          a) Once the machinery is in place, office work (and
               other work) becomes automated to the point where
               jobs can be eliminated and deskilled.

          b) For many secretaries and clerical works ("pink
               collar" jobs), computers are both eliminating
               drudgery and creating factory-like conditions.

          c) Computerization alienates people from the process of
               their work when the work becomes so fragmented or
               repetitive that it ceases to have any meaning.

          d) The social consequences of computer applications to
               work do not depend so much on the technology
               itself as on the implementers' assumptions and
               actions.

          e) All of the Above


               Answer:
                    Choice e) All of the Above




     3) One of the clearest trends in computerized work has been
          the automation of the "labor aristocracy" (the skilled
          blue-collar worker) through the use of robots. Which of
          the following statements is/are true about the
          Blue-Collar Robots and their effect on the work force?

          a) The robotics phenomenon could bring both increased
               levels of productivity and greater unemployment.

          b) The "psychological impact" of automation (by robots)
               is far greater than outside observers imagine ===>
               many workers complain of loneliness, feelings of
               worthlessness, and feelings of extra stress from
               the strain added by working with computers and
               robots. 

          c) Robots are fast and dependable; their performance is
               regular and predictable; unlike people, they do
               not grow tired, frustrated, or bored; and robots
               do not need to be retrained for new production
               changes -- they only need to be reprogrammed.

          d) Answers a)  and  c)  are correct

          e) All of the Above


               Answer:
                    Choice e) All of the Above

               person's professional occupation.

          b) In general, (especially in the past) most
               white-collar crimes tend to be dealt with in civil
               court rather than in criminal court.

          c) Most of the crimes so far detected have been
               conducted by people with fairly limited knowledge
               of computers.

          d) What seems to underlie the leniency towards
               white-collar crimes is our soceity's apparent

               criminal offenses.

          e) All of the Above

     2) Which of the following statments describe patents and
          copyrights?

          b) Mathematical formulas or "obvious" processes cannot
               be patented. Patents are not given for abstract

               the information does not have to be filed with the
               copyright or patent office, so there is no        
               expiration date for the protection.

          e) All of the Above

                      Information as Power:
                  Computers and Social Decisions


                   3 Exam Questions and Answers

          particular company or industry; it includes ethical
          standards and the criteria by which managers will be
          judged successful.

          a) Family Culture
          b) Corporate Management
          c) Corporate Psychology
          d) Corporate Culture
          e) None of the Above


               Answer:
                    Choice  d) Corporate Culture



     2) Many times people use models to help understand complex
          problems. Chapter 9 talked about computer modeling
          and policy-making. Which of the following statemets    
          are true about "computer modeling and policy-making"?

          a) Computer models have an enormous impact on
               policy-making by raising long-range planning
               issues.   
          
          b) Appropriate use of computer models can be a very
               helpful aid to humans for understanding complex
               problems of the physical environment or the
               intricacies of international relations.

          c) One of the earliest models was the "Limits to Growth
               Model" which placed issues of world food
               shortages, population growth, pollution, and
               natural resource depletion on the policy agenda of
               many national and international bodies.

          d) Projective models tell us "what if" under a wide
               variety of approximate conditions; predictive

     3) Chapter 9 talked about using information as power --
          the influence of computers on information and power,
          and the social decisions that are related to           
          information as power. Which of the following statemets 
          is/are true about "Information as Power"?

          a) Decision making requires power; those who have
               information, especially those who beleive that
               they can only understand it, have power over
               society's decisions.

          b) It is not the computer itself that influences the
               distribution of power in society; it is the way
               the computer system is designed and used.

          c) Because information is itself a means of exercising
               power, struggles to acquire it and maintain
               control over it can occur.

          d) Answers  a)  and  c)  are correct  

          e) All of the Above 


                    Answer:
                         Choice  e) All of the Above

What is telecommuting? (p160)
	Telecommuting is an arrangement of work in which employees
	are geographically scattered.  Instead of a centralized
	factory or office with face-to-face supervision of their
	specialized tasks, coordination and control functions are

	Robots are fast and dependable; their performance is regular and
	predictable; unlike people, they do not grow tired, frustrated, or
	bored.  When production requirements change a robot need not be
	retrained or even redesigned, but simply reprogrammed.

What is alienation? (p173)
	In its psychological sense, alienation implies isolation from
	other people and from one's surroundings.

Chapter 1.

1. [From pp. 11-12]

   Q. Describe ENTROPY as it relates to the process of
      program design and development. Describe one method
      for avoiding entropy in software development, that may
      be implemented in the design phase.

   A. ENTROPY is the tendency for systems to become more and
      more disordered over time.  In relation to software
      design and development, entropy might occur as more and
      more information about the problem is accumulated. For
      large and complex systems this is likely to happen as
      more people are given the responsibility of studying
      and designing specific portions of the system.  Without
      a systematic method of accumulating, centralizing, and
      evaluating this information disorganization and
      information overload could settle in, leaving the
      direction of the overall design much in doubt.  (There
      are examples, as we've been told about in different
      courses, where the product ran near to perfection, but
      did not come close in solving the original problem).

      One method of avoiding this would be to designate, in
      the design phase, a person who's sole task is to
      accumulate, store and report on the various problems
      faced by different engineers in their designs. As
      smaller tasks are more easily organized than larger
      ones, this would free the engineers from having to be
      aware of what the rest of the team was doing, and
      having to figure out the side-effects of their
      particular solution.  "Black-boxing" in the design
      phase, in other words.

   Q. Describe how computers affect property relationships.

   A. Computers (and thus information access and use) are
      changing the types of jobs that are available, and
      ultimately the industries that hire people. Those who
      are more able to take advantage of this situation will
      undoubtedly accumulate more and more of the wealth, while
      those in traditional labor fields will tend to have
      less and less of an economic impact. This leads to a
      redistribution of wealth, and would seem to create a
      whole sub-culture in itself - the computer literate
      middle management person who has access to vast amounts
      of information.

      The relationship between people and information has
      been greatly affected by computers - at this point
      there seems to be a contradiction in operation.  With
      the passage of the Freedom of Information Act we now
      have access to not only information about ourselves,
      but also about others.  Information that could be
      considered the property of one institution may be
      easily accessed by another, thus affecting "ownership"
      of that information. At what point is this illegal? At
      what point is this assessing of another's information
      unethical? And where does the right to privacy fit in?
      Finally, if I have information about something, and I
      can use this to my advantage, is this information
      considered my property? If someone would gain access to
      this information, and use it to their own advantage,
      without my knowledge and permission, did  they steal it
      from me?


3. [This question was not addressed directly in Chapter 1,
    but seemingly was hinted at a few times.]

   Q. Name one past promise of the "computer revolution"
      that has failed to materialize, and explain why you
      think this has happened.

   A. (One of many, I'm sure). An obvious one is the
      computerization of the student-teacher relationship.
      The promise was of long distance, multi-media teaching,
      (via TV cameras, computer hookups, etc.) where many
      students, some of them home bound, others at job sites,
      would have immediate access to the instructor and on-
      line information. This is my 5th year in computer
      science. It is now 1993. I have been a student at two
      different state institutions, both of them held in high
      regard in the community (and in the country) for their
      computer science departments.  Both have had access to
      large amounts of money. I have yet  to see my first
      video lecture. Nor have I had any dealing, with the
      exception of a few e-mail question and answer letters,
      with any instant on-line course help. It is not
      possible to access a classroom from home or the job
      site under any circumstances, with the exception of a
      few high-tech instances that have been related in
      lectures and national magazines.

      There are two broad reasons for this, I think. One, the
      difficulty of transporting video images was
      underestimated, as was the difficulty in implementing a
      many-to-one electronic accessing system, when the
      'many' and 'one' are human beings.

      Two, the assumption was (and still is in almost
      everything I read, about the future of computer
      applications) that somehow, some way, those with the
      money, knowledge and computer resources would agree on
      common goals and efficient methods, and get down to the
      business of developing systems for the common good.
      Wrong.  Competition, seemingly arbitrary decisions that
      are counter-productive, and multi-million dollar
      advertising campaigns that are designed to upgrade the
      image of a product (while the same old inadequate
      product is offered - ie: MS-DOS) seem to be the norm.
      Personally, I am amazed that any large system works at
      all. (For example, try reading the AS/400 help screens
      as if they were design specifications).  The common
      wisdom among the non-computer literate population seems
      to have it that computers have minds of their own, are
      at times devious, and are capable of making extremely
      intelligent decisions given seemingly unrelated bits and
      pieces of information. If only they knew.  [Sorry, I
      didn't mean to get carried away.] On the other hand,
      this document was spell-checked by a computer program,
      which I personally think is one of the greatest things
      to come out of the computer revolution!


Chapter 2

1. [From p. 32]

   Q.  Describe structural change and how it might apply to the field
       of computer science.

   A.  Structural change is a process that occurs when social
       positions (such as particular occupations) are being eliminated
       or created.  A structure grows as new positions are created,
       and shrinks as old positions are eliminated.

       In the field of computers, the traditional entry-level software
       occupations (designer-programmer, operator, data-entry) are
       either shrinking or growing, depending on where one gets their
       information. In microworld settings (local firms, maybe a small
       town or area) structural changes in the computer job market
       would seem to be in flux - which is not unusual given the
       tendency of local economies themselves to be somewhat unstable.
       In a macroworld setting, however, with 10 % of the world's GNP
       tied up in computers and computer-related things, and given the
       fact that despite the continuing advances in hardware and
       design the main business language is still COBOL, the main
       vehicle for data entry is the keyboard, and information
       retrieval is a function of disk seek times, there would seem to
       be no overall shortages for opportunity at the entry level.  If
       no catastrophic changes occur in the world's political and
       economic systems, one would think that this is likely to
       continue to grow.

2. [From p. 33]

   Q.  Describe revolutionary change. Has the computer "revolution"
       happened?

   A.  According to the text revolutionary change is rapid,
       disruptive, and often violent, causing change from one
       relatively stable form of society into another.

       The computer revolution, (in my opinion), for all the hype and
       promise, has been neither rapid nor disruptive, and certainly
       not violent. For the daily operations of dealing with the ins
       and outs, ups and downs of life in this society, there have
       been mostly subtle changes in the way we deal with things
       (going to an ATM instead of a bank window, getting on a
       computer generated mailing list rather than a hand- generated
       one, creating documents with a word- processor rather than a
       typewriter). Within the very narrow confines of specific
       applications, there may have been improvements (and some of
       them extensive), but nothing that could be classified as
       revolutionary, I think.

3. [From p. 37]

   Q.  Under what circumstances might a computer be limiting?

   A.  When the application confines one to a limited set of
       activities or inputs. For example, if a company's personnel
       database limited the number of characters for a name field to
       8, and allowed no duplication in that field, all persons named
       Johannson would be prohibited from working for that company. It
       could be argued, I think, that because applications are created
       by people, and people have a tendency to limit based on their
       experience and the tools at hand, most applications arbitrarily
       exclude classes of input - and in some cases these exclusions
       may have far reaching consequences.


Chapter 3.

1. Q. Make a case for the statement, "Computers represent a
      revolutionary change."

   A. Computers represent a change in emphasis from
      production to processing. With extremely large amounts
      of (possibly) pertinent information available, the task
      would now seem to be how to efficiently process it,
      rather than how to produce it.  This is not to say that
      production would be trivial, but if all information
      production were halted today I believe that there would
      be enough information to assimilate, permute, compare,
      re-classify, etc. to keep computers in business for a
      long, long time. I don't think that the subtitles of
      this shift will become generally obvious for a while,
      just like the agricultural and industrial revolutions
      weren't generally obvious for a period of time.


2. Q. Make a case for the statement, "Computers represent an
      evolutionary change."

   A. In one form or another, man has always processed
      information. For a million years the "computer" was
      grunts, cave drawings, crude sign language, among other
      things. Around 30,000 years ago people began developing
      more efficient, lasting ways of processing information
      that led to structured languages, mathematics, and
      alphabets. For the last 1000 years people have been
      deriving more efficient and consistent means of
      storage.  I think that, given the electronic age and
      the unrestricted dissemination of this knowledge
      through universities and businesses, and the high value
      that humans place on information, the computer as we
      know it is the next logical evolutionary step in
      information processing and storage.



3. [From p. 67]

   Q. What is the modern origin of the word "computer."

   A. The word computer was first used to describe the jobs
      of women who performed calculations and wired hardware
      for the ENIAC.



Chapter 4

1. [From pp. 76-78]

   Q.  Define the goals of ergonomics as it relates to computers.

   A.  Ergonomics looks at the match between the machine and the user
       as a biological organism. It includes the study of such things
       as screen design, physical layout (table, chairs, etc.) and
       keyboard response times, and how these may affect a user's
       stress level.  According to some social psychologists, the goal
       of ergonomics research is not to meet the needs of individuals,
       but to raise productivity.


2. [From pp. 9]

   Q.  Describe computer phobia, how it may be detected, and steps
       that may ease the stress of such users.

   A.  Computer phobia is an extreme fear of computers, as
       differentiated from occasional stress or reluctance. Some
       symptoms may include agitation at the mention of a user
       completing a task on a computer, avoidance of physical contact
       with a computer, preoccupation with the fear of loosing one's
       job to a computer (which may be real), and refusal to
       acknowledge their increasing importance in most day to day
       business operations.

       Those with computer phobia may be aided by friendly interfaces
       (noting that multiple-colors, scroll bars, mice, and groups of
       icons do not necessarily a friendly interface make), easy to
       interpret and apply written instructions, "cheat sheets"
       containing a few of the most common commands and their effect
       on the operation of the machine, and most of all a supportive
       and sensitive staff of co-workers and supervisors.


3. [From pp. 8]

   Q.  What are some of the ways to combat stress in a
       computer-saturated work environment.

   A.  Some of the methods are giving the worker more control at the
       terminal, organizing tasks so that a person is not doing
       continual keying, and allowing the worker to have some control
       over the tempo of their work.

   Q.  Give an example of a dangerous situation arising from
       computer-related alienation.

   A.  An air traffic controller who's job has been narrowed
       down to a series of computer controlled tasks. In
       some cases a controller may loose touch with an
       actual situation that is happening, and in a moment of
       conflict may opt for the computer's "explanation" of
       the event rather than his own experience and
       judgement.

2. [pp. 216-217]

   Q.  Describe a situation where corporate culture enables
       incompetence rather than promoting initiative.

   A.  The tendency to reward those who develop attractive design
       aids, rather than those who develop functional designs,
       seemingly. I think that the software industry as a whole has
       tended to become obsessed with "user friendliness" and Windows
       formats rather than looking at the real functionality of their
       products. I am now seeing examples where the icon designer is
       given equal billing with the author in Windows applications.


3. Q.  Describe a scenario where those who have access to information
       have control over those who don't.

   A.  In the stock market, knowledge of a company's plans, problems,
       and internal changes can affect it's growth. If one were to
       gain this information before it became public knowledge (and
       assuming it was of sufficient importance), one could affect the
       value of the company's stocks, could have an affect on the
       personnel of the company (by playing out bits and pieces of the
       information) and have a great advantage over shareholders
       without that knowledge.

1. Describe "fair use" as it pertains to the 1976 copy protection
   laws.

   Fair use may be claimed when using another's copyrighted work if
   the used portion is short, is not a significant portion of the
   original work, or is not a significant portion of the new context.
   For fair use one need not obtain permission from the copyright
   holder, or cite the original author.

2. What three ingredients are needed to copyright an article?

   A copy (sometimes two) of the work, the proper form, and the
   registration fee.

3. Describe the differences between ethical and legal obligations as
   they pertain to copyrighting and publishing.

   Ethical obligations are a superset of legal obligations. Usually,
   obligations not covered by law are governed by institutions,
   publishers and authors, and by conventions of one's field. While
   ethical lapses may have no legal outcome, strong pressure from
   one's field may lead to dismissal and disgrace. Certain ethical
   obligations may at times be superseded by other considerations,
   but only if all parties concerned are informed. Legal obligations,
   on the other hand, are usually inflexible.

With respect to the characteristics of new surveillance and information
gathering techniques, are the following three questions True or False?

1)  Since they are capital rather than labor intensive, it is increasingly
    less economical for the watchers to collect their information;  it has
    become more expensive per unit watched.  

2)  They trigger a shift from targeting a specific suspect to catagorical
    suspicion of everyone (or at least everyone in a particular catagory).

3)  The watchers usually make their presence known to the watchees because
    this is more ethical and it leads to prevention rather than detection
    and confrontation after the fact.  (eg, clothing stores, supermarkets,   
    etc, usually have highly visible signs that let you know that you are
    being watched)
   
Answers: 1)  False
         2)  True
