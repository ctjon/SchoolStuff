	I am planning to keep an archive of all questions and answers for
cs489 homework assignments.  Dr. Perrizo said that he would take a significant
portion of the final exam questions from the questions we turn in as a class.
I plan that this archive would be available to all who participate in its
construction.  If you are not interested that is fine but please let me know.
If we do this as a class it will give everyone the same advantage in studying
for the final test.  If you are interested here is what you must do.

When you finish your questions for a chapter or paper email the questions and
answers to me (tjon@plains) with a subject heading of "Questions # ??" where ??
is the number of the assignment they are for.  I will then place them in a
directory where everyone can read/print them out.  That directory will be:

/student/mnt/xd8g/89/tjon/src/class/cs489/questions

for those of you who use vm logins(sajmb and glum) I can mail you the completed
archive in time for the final or print it out and bring it to class for you.

If the questions and answers are done in class it is not important.  Just make
enough notes on another sheet to be able to go to a terminal and type in what
you wrote.

I assume we all want A's.  This archive will not guarantee anything but it
will certainly help.
