	Our group is trying to understand the functionality of the semaphore
functions.  Here is what we've figure they do:

        s_create -> allocates new semaphore
                    no-one given access to it yet though
                    calling thread "owns" semaphore
 
        s_destroy -> deallocates semaphore (if not in use)

        s_open    -> gives a thread access to the semaphore and returns
                     a "handle" (SID).

        s_close   -> releases access to a semaphore 

        s_signal  -> UP's a semaphore, releasing the resource.
                     If threads are blocked waiting for a resource,
                     it gives one thread the resource--putting it on
                     ready status.

        s_wait    -> DOWN's a semaphore, taking a resource.
                    thread is blocked if no resources left. 


	Are we understanding this clearly?
