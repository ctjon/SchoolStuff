Please read ~roehrich/cs475/doc/hand_in for a description of what you should
hand in.  On March 4 you will need to put your source in
/contrib/cs475/<groupname>.  Please make sure the tar file you put there is
world readable (so I can read it).  No other groups will be able to get to
your directory, so this should be ok.


In ~roehrich/cs475/assign1/tlib you will find the file tg.o which contains
the test threads you must link into your program.  There are some "Readme"
files which describe what the different threads are trying to do.
