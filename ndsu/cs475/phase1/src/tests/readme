The object file tg.o contains the functions which are described in the
Readme-tg* files:

	int tg1( void );
	int tg2( void );
	int tg3( void );

These are in the file tg.h, which you may wish to include into your program.

The sample Makefile has been updated to link this new .o into the program.
You should notice that this .o is not listed on a dependency line, it is
simply linked in.  Also notice it is not necessary for you to make your own
copy of this .o.

Note that the assign1.txt file specifies 3 .o files, one for each function.
I've linked those 3 into a single .o, and this should make things a little
more clean.


See the file ~roehrich/cs475/doc/hand_in for a description of what you
should hand in.  On March 4 you will need to put your source in
/contrib/cs475/<groupname>.  Please make sure the tar file you put there is
world readable (so I can read it).  No other groups will be able to get to
your directory, so this should be ok.
