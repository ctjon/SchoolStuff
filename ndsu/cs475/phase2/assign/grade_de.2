-1	ITC and Filesystem documentation.
	When I got to the end of your document, I realized that everything I
	knew about these 2 features came from a couple of paragraphs which
	did little more than give me an overview.

9/10


===========

o	Worth points: Last time I requested that everyone give me a tar file
	of their project, and that they make that tar file world readable.
	A couple of groups did not do this, and I had to get some help to
	read their projects.  This time if I cannot read your OS I will
	deduct a point.




grading criteria:

-1  If your OS can lose messages.
-1  If you duplicated features your OS already has.
	Buffer space for the messages.
	Blocked lists.
	Synchronization.
-1  If you did not describe some important feature.
	File System.
	ITC
	Spooler threads, master thread, command thread.
-1  If you were lost.  (No one this time, thankfully.)

Comments this time were fairly sparse.  Everyone has a pretty good handle on
how this thing will work.
