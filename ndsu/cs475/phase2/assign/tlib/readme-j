CS475 - Operating System Design
Assignment 2
Job Stream 2


This job stream you should run through your completed system.  It is a large
stream of jobs which should test the limiting of the number of threads and/or
files you allow in your system.  90 jobs are included.

You may wish to either link this job stream (js2) as INPUT, or copy it into
your project directory.  To link this, you can apply the following command,
assuming you link it on the same file system:
	ln ~roehrich/assign2/tlib/js2 INPUT
If you link it to a different file system, you need to use symbolic links.
This is done with the following command:
	ln -s ~roehrich/assign2/tlib/js2 INPUT
