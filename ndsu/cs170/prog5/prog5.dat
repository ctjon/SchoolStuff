This whole file (including these very words) is the test data for the fifth
programming problem;  it contains a number of words with some words occurring
more than once.  It was a description that I gave in a previous quarter to help the
students structure their code so as to produce a "well-structured", more
"elegant" solution.
The fifth programming assignment is on page 283.  Do problem number 10.
Use an array of records where each record contains the word and the count
for that word.  You will  have  to  guess at the size for the array but
if you declare it in a constant declaration it will be easy to change
when you find out just how big it needs to be to run with the data.  Keep
track of how many words are in the array at any given time with a
variable.  Make good use of procedures.  You might consider
breaking the problem solution up into pieces as follows:
Create a module Words, which has operations, IsAnotherWord, GetNextWord,
and any other operations you think you might need, such as a routine to
ConvertToUpperCase.  Create a module WordList that has the array
of words and frequencies as a type, and provides operations to insert
a word in the list, to see if a word is present already, to increment
the count for a word that is present, to sort the list, to display the
list, and any other operations you discover you need.  The solution
can then be described in terms of these various operations in a
straight-forward way. Build and test these modules then do the solution
to the given problem in terms of the new operations you have created.
