A few comments:

I would like to see a better explanation of the program.
A one line comment will not suffice a few weeks later in the quarter.
Every procedure/functions should have a few comments at the beginning.

delete_client & delete_supply
change_client & change_supply
The above functions are repeated. If the number of files is 10, 
would you write 10 deletes and 10 changes? 

The hand out very clearly states in "what to hand in", that you
should hand in the error.log file.

Transactions DL SP 7  and CH SP 25 amount=17 are reported
as errors.  While it can be argued that deleting or changing records
that do not exist in the database should be reported as errors.
It's not an invalid transaction

Points: 11/15

I would like to remind you that 
there is a difference between reading character at a time
and reading line at a time.

Since we are reading transactions/queries and we are dealing
with databases, it is considerable better to execute/read
transactions/queries at a time.

thanks
-Juan
