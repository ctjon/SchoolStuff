Juan and I checked your programme once again.

I agree with you that your programme work correct on xaction files.
It really distinct cases of wrong syntax and records missing in 
master files.

I disagree about change/delete functions. This is a very bad style
to write a new function per each master file. You should share them
and have 2 functions instead of 4.

Overall your comments are really pure, here I agree with Juan.

As for a loss of your reports, I don't have any, and I don't have
any reason to think that Juan lost them. But as you insists you submitted it,
I guess we can share responsibility.

I think that 12.5 is a right score for this asgn. I updated my list of grades.
