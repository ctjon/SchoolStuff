As mentioned in class, I have created ~gammill/cs474/lib which contains
the source and object for the library file, libnet.a.  Use the Makefile
(modified) to create this.  Also, you need to know that the various
mechanisms that select what kind of system this is, occasionally fail.
When that happens, you should assure them that this is a BSD system. 
Generally either sun or bsd will get the right results.  Changes that
need to be made in inettime.c involve changeing err_dump to err_ret
and remembering to close(fd) and return.  Finally, if you find that
your inettime cannot find off-campus computers by name (such as
louie.udel.edu or cobber.cord.edu) then you need to change the cc line
in your Makefile to have "-lresolv" to get the name resolver library
linked in with your code.  Good luck.   Bob
