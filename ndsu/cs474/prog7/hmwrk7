        Fall 1992     CS/EE 474 - Operating System Concepts    R. Gammill


        Homework #7: due at class time on Monday November 23, 1992

        Compile      and      run      inettime      as      found     in
        /keeper/doc/networking/netprog/inettime.  This  program  collects
        two  kinds  of  time  from  a server, using both TCP and UDP (TCP
        transmission  control protocol establishes a connection, gets the
        time, and hangs up, while UDP user datagram protocol simply ships
        packets).  As written, the code aborts as soon as a server  fails
        to  properly handle its request, often failing to try other forms
        of the request which would have succeeded.  In  particular,  this
        happens  with  vm1.nodak.edu.   Fix  this  problem, and any other
        problems you may find.  Also,  make  sure  the  output  from  the
        program  is  explicit  in  identifying  what problem arose from a
        particular request.  Be sure to document exactly what you had  to
        do  to  libraries and code to get the program to compile and work
        properly.  Speaking of libraries, you will need  the  library  of
        source code routines found in ~gammill/cs474/lib (which came from
        the  netprog/lib  in  /keeper).   Documenting  your changes is an
        important skill and simulates what you would have to  do  on  the
        job  to  document  for  the  next  systems  jock how you modified
        things.  Test inettime on a number of kinds of servers  (such  as
        Solbourne, Sun, IBM mainframe, AT&T 3B2, HP 300, AS400, etc.)
