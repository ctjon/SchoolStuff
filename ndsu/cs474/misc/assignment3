This is your third assignment for CS 474.
Do anonymous ftp (be sure you can spell it) on VM1 and retrieve the file
RFC1118.TXT onto plains.  Be sure to do a directory exam while there (either
ls or dir).  To do anonymous ftp you use the command "ftp vm1" on plains
(see man ftp for more information).  When it askes for your login, say
anonymous.  When it asks for a password, give it your actual name and home
computer, e.g. gammill at plains.  Now do a dir.  Then do a "get rfc1118.txt"
and the file will show up in the directory from which you called ftp.  Now
use a text editor and select me out the 1000-th line of this file and send
that to me to show that you have completed the assignment.  Be sure to use
a Subject: CS474 line to keep me happy.  You should also use the help command
inside ftp, to be sure you know how to get at it.  Knowing how to use help
commands is VERY important.   Good luck.   Bob
P.S. There are thousands of host machines where you can do anonymous ftp.
You might find it fun to find someplace off campus where you can pick up
files.  Ask a friend for a suggestion.  Also, read some of the RFC.
