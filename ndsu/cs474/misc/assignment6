        This  is an exercise in using "whois", "finger" and "nslookup" in
        finding the internet mail address of someone at a distance.   For
        each  person  whose  mail  address  you are able to find you must
        provide the following information, which you will send me via  e-
        mail.

          1.  The  output  of  the  function which gave you the top level
             domain name and name  server  in  which  the  person's  mail
             address  resides.   All  of these people are in .EDU, so top
             level here means the domain below that.

          2. The sequence of steps (possibly empty) which allowed you  to
             find  the  host  machine  within the domain where the person
             receives his mail.  P.T. Magee has a generic  mailbox  which
             is given out by finger on umn.edu.  That address has no host
             machine specified.  I want his host machine and login.

          3. The output of the finger call which verifies that the person
             has  a  login on the chosen host machine, giving all of that
             person's logins.

        The following list of person's should be "found" on the internet.
        DO NOT send mail to any of them, as they have no idea their names
        are being used.

          1. Rick Walker's logins at Moorhead State University.  Find all
             of them.

          2. Craig Lien at Concordia College.

          3. Denbigh Starkey, Chair of CS at Montana State University.

          4. Paul T. Magee, Chair of Molecular Biology,  located  in  the
             Center   for   Biological  Sciences  at  the  University  of
             Minnesota.

	For this assignment ONLY person number 3 (Denbigh Starkey) is required.
	All others are optional.
