Your second assignment is to send mail to "boing" as shown in the .mailrc
file entry below:

alias	boing	answering-machine@cobber.cord.edu

Please put this alias into your .mailrc file.  The
mail you send can be empty, but you SHOULD have a reasonable subject line.
Boing will return your mail, with some wisecracks by Glen Overby.  The 
returned mail is to be sent to me by including it in a piece of mail.
