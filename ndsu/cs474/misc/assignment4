WELCOME TO THE FOURTH NET ASSIGNMENT FOR CS/EE 496 (Local Area Networks).
	(late night and weekend use makes Internet more responsive)

   1. First you are to use "ping".  Ping is slightly hidden, to keep the
      masses from using it wastefully.  You should run it carefully, and
      interrupt out of it after between 5 and 10 packets have been sent.
      To use it, start with "/etc/ping vm1".  Then go to "/etc/ping ndgate"
      and finally "/etc/ping cobber.cord.edu".  To interrupt use ctrl-C.

   2. Now run "traceroute cordgate.cord.edu".  Interrupt out of this one 
      if it malfunctions by hitting ctrl-C.  I have substituted cordgate
      for cobber because being a Solbourne and running Sun-OS it fails to
      handle traceroute packets correctly.  It is only one step past cordgate.

   3. Now run "gopher" on plains.  This gives you access to different
      data bases  at other sites.  Try some things.  See if you understand
      the user interface.  Tell me the number of "european gophers."

Send me mail telling me:
	1. The min/avg/max times for pinging cobber.
	2. How many steps it takes to get to cordgate.
	3. The number of European gophers.
Have fun:  Bob
