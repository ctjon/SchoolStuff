  Homework #6: due at class time on Friday, October 30, 1992
       (NO late homework accepted without prior permission!)

  This  will be a relatively simple assignment whose goal is to make sure you
  know exactly what the inode under UNIX contains!

  Write an inode dump routine  using  stat(2).   Print  out  all  the  useful
  information  in as compact and readable a form as possible.  Be sure to use
  ctime(3) to convert modification time to ASCII, and be sure to format  your
  output  nicely  with  labels  for  each item so that the results are easily
  understood.  Also, be sure to test your inode dump  on  as  many  different
  kinds  of  inodes  as  you  can  find!   Don't  forget  character and block
  specials, files with SETUID or SETGID, files  with  several  links,  and  a
  directory  or  so.  If you can find a socket or other unusual type of  file
  that will be good to!

  To  do  this  assignment  right  you  will probably need the manual page on
  stat(2).  The following is a brief summary of that from V7 UNIX.

  STAT(2)

  NAME
          stat, fstat - get file status
  SYNOPSIS
          #include <sys/types.h>
          #include <sys/stat.h>

          stat(name,buf)
          char *name; struct stat *buf;

          fstat(fildes,buf)
          struct stat *buf;

  DESCRIPTION
          Stat obtains detailed information about a named file.       
          Fstat obtains the same information about an open file
          known by the file descriptor from a successful open,
          creat, dup or pipe(2) call.  Name points to a null
          terminated string.  Read the included files for details
          of the buf struct into which info is retrieved.
