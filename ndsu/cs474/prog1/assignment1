        Homework #1: due at class on Wednesday September 16, 1992

        Write a filter "prep" which splits its text input into words, one
        word  per  line,  all  alphabetic  characters translated to lower
        case, and puts this result on its standard output.   You  are  to
        write  the  program  in C using getchar for input and putchar for
        output.  This program will be tested by using it with sort,  uniq
        and  pr  to  produce  a  four  or  five column output of how many
        occurrences of different words there were in  the  text  of  this
        homework   assignment   (found  in  ~gammill/cs474/hmwrk1).   The
        definition of what a "word" is  follows  the  paper  "Statistical
        Text  Processing"  pp.  2137-2154  in  the  Bell System Technical
        Journal, July-August 1978.  To summarize those  conventions,  all
        punctuation  and  white  space  (made  up  of  blanks, \t and \n)
        separates words.  Hyphens are also word separators.   Apostrophes
        in  the  interior  of a word are part of the word (e.g. cat's and
        don't), but apostrophes before or after a word are not (e.g. 'tis
        and Chris').  Numeric digit characters are not parts of words and
        numbers are not words.

        Your output will be produced by the command sequence:

          prep < ~gammill/cs474/hmwrk1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | pr

        However, you will need to give pr some arguments to get  four  or
        five  column format (the least number of colums to get everything
        on one page) and a nice heading indicating who you are  and  what
        is  being  done.   Be  sure  the comments at the beginning of the
        source listing of your program contain  identifying  information.
        Turn  your source code (with pr heading) and output of the run in
        on eight and 1/2 by eleven inch paper.
