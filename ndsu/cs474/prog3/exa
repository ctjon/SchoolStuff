This is an example to show that the macro processor can handle ordinary
text, so long as it does not contain any $$ signs, and simply copies
from its standard input to its standard output.  However, macros may
be very useful in providing tables:
$- begin macro definitions
$@|
|$@=n012$@'3   '$@=t011$@.I$n$t$%%) .$
$- the following is the table
$I31BOYS$ItaBob$ItbJoe$ItcJim$n$I32GIRLS$ItaJill$ItbMary$n
The only problems can occur $
$1 here we are invisibly glueing together two sentences
when a $$ sign occurs in the text in an
unforseen way as in $503.45.  That would be unfortunate.
In addition, it is important that a % sign in the text have no
effect (% is meaningful only inside a macro body) and $% should
always be an undefined macro, unless it appears in a macro body or 
$0'%has been defined.'$
$%
