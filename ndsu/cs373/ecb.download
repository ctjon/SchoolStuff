                   Downloading to ECB from a PACX mainframe

       The  Educational  Computer  Boards (ECB) in EEE 218 are very nice
       68000 test systems in that they have  a  "transparent  mode"  (TM
       command)  that  allows  the  user  to login on a remote mainframe
       and do such things as keeping a log (using the LG command) or now
       we want to describe how you can download S-records.

         1.  First  make  sure  the terminal is set at 1200 bps.  You do
            this using the MENU and SYSTEM/USER keys  to  get  a  system
            menu.   It  shows you that f8 is "config keys", so hit that.
            Next you see a menu that shows that f3 is "datacomm config",
            so hit that.  Now you have a menu that shows  BPS.   Use  f2
            "next  choice"  and  f3  "prev. choice" to get the speed you
            need (1200) and then use f1 "save config"  to  install  that
            speed.   If  the speed is correct to begin with, do nothing.
            Also, make sure you are in CAPS mode  by  hitting  the  CAPS
            key.

         2.  Turn  on  the  "Terminal  to ECB" blue box (LDS125) and hit
            return.  When you are asked for "class", give 4-31 or  4-32,
            depending  upon  which  ECB  is  available  and running (see
            labels on top of ECB cases).

         3. When you receive the TUTOR 1.3> (or similar) prompt, you are
            logged into the ECB.  Now issue a TM command.

         4. Hit a RETURN and when class is requested, give the class  of
            the  mainframe  you want to download from (e.g. HP-UX on the
            9040 is 4-hp).  Then login on that machine as  you  normally
            do.   It  is  now  possible  to  do  an assembly to generate
            downloadable object code (in S-record format),  but  usually
            you should not tie up an ECB while doing that!

         5.  Exit  "transparency  mode" by holding down the CTRL key and
            hitting A  on  your  terminal  keyboard  to  send  a  CTRL-A
            character  to  the  ECB.  One slight difficulty is that this
            CTRL-A is ALSO sent  to  the  mainframe,  so  to  keep  from
            fouling  up what follows, type "* <RETURN>" (i.e.  asterisk,
            space, carriage-return to the ECB) which sends an empty line
            to the mainframe, flushing out  the  CTRL-A.   Now  you  are
            ready to download.

         6.  Type  "LO;X=cat  object" to the ECB (if you are downloading
            from HP-UX).  The quotation  marks  are  NOT  to  be  typed.
            Watch  the  S-records  being listed on your terminal screen!
            When the download (which was caused  by  the  command  given
            after  X=) is done, your object file should now be loaded on
            the ECB.  Use an MD command to check that it worked.

         7. Be SURE to go back into TM mode and logout on the  mainframe
            before  getting  off  the  ECB.   If  you forget to do this,
            someone else may login on the ECB and use TM and trash  your
            files,  so you should probably do it before you forget!  You
            get back to the ECB again with CTRL-A.

            Now  you  are ready to run your program on the ECB.  Be sure
            to remember to enter break points so you do not lose control
            of the ECB, since it will not trap out on a BRA * loop  like
            M68KS.

         8. Be sure to turn off the "Terminal to ECB" blue box to logout
            of  the  ECB  when  you  are  all done.  Also, turn off your
            terminal, preferrably leaving it in 1200 BPS mode (no action
            necessary).  Also, be sure to leave the ECB running properly
            so off-campus users can get at it.
