        Homework #9: due at class on Wednesday December 8, 1993.

        Write  a  program  to  take  a  C program as input and substitute
        different key words for all its reserved words.  Be sure  not  to
        change  any  reserved  words which occur in comments or in quoted
        text.  You must demonstrate that this has been accomplished.

        INPUT FILE

        One line for each keyword.  First the keyword  then one  or  more
        blanks  followed by the word to be substituted.  The last line of
        these words is to be followed  by  a  line  containing  just  the
        character '$'.  This is then to be followed by the program.  e.g.

           int     integer
           if      ifyouwantto
           for     because
           $
           main()
           {   /* for sure check if comments containing int don't change */
             int i;
             for (i=0,i < 26,i++) if(i == 2) printf("for what if %d n",i);
           }

        PROGRAM NOTES

        For  this  program  it  is  enough  to show that your program can
        convert about 10 distinct C keywords into  your  'new  language'.
        Use  a  small  but  through test set (say about 10 to 20 lines of
        selected C).

        REQUIREMENTS

        You should get some experience using pointers, so you must  store
        your  dictionary (reserved word, substitution string) pairs using
        pointers to strings where the  space  for  the  string  has  been
        allocated using malloc (or similar function).  Arrays of pointers
        to  strings,  where the arrays are allocated at compile time, but
        the strings are allocated  at  runtime  are  suggested.   Helpful
        hint: malloc(strlen(s)+1);
