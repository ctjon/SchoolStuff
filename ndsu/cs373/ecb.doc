      The  following  is  a  general  guide  to  starting up the ECB and 
      using  a  few  of  the  basic  instructions.   For  more  detailed  
      information refer to the ECB manual found in EEE218.  

      Getting Started  

      The  ECB  must be operated via a terminal.  The terminal should be 
      set at 2400 baud.  Only upper case letters are recognized  by  the 
      ECB.   The ECB's are currently connected to class    31 and    32.
      To enter the ECB environment, turn on the PACX  box and  hit <CR>.
      IBM 3270 terminal's will not work.   When  you  are  prompted with
      "enter class", respond with   31 or   32, then <CR>.   You will be
      dropped immediately into the ECB  environment.  The  display  will 
      show "TUTOR 1.X >", where the X denotes the version number.  
      
      Using the ECB  

      From  the ECB's prompt,  any valid command can be entered.  Only a 
      few  of  these  will  be  discussed  in  this  introduction.   Any 
      manipulation  of  memory  must occur in user RAM.  The user ram is 
      from $000900 to $007FFF.  

      MS <address> <data...> <CR>                         "Memory Store"
           
           Values  for  the  address  and  data  should  be  entered  in 
           hexidecimal.   A  space  should  separate  each entry.   More 
           than  one  data  item   can  be specified.  The address shows 
           where the first data item should be stored.  Each  additional 
           data item is stored after its predecessor.

           EX:  MS 900 23 24 25 <CR> will put 23 in location 900,  24 in 
           location  901,  and  25  in  location  902.   These  are  all
           hexidecimal numbers.  

      MD <address> <count> ;<option> <CR>               "Memory Display"

           This command will display the contents  of  memory  from  the 
           specified address, for the count specified,  in blocks of 16.  
           The option specifies whether or not you want  a  disassembled 
           version  of  the  output.  That  option  is  specified by the 
           typing DI after the ';' in the command line.  

           EX:  MD 900 3 would show data contained in  location  900  to 
           910.  By  typing  in  "MD  900  3  ;DI"  you  would  see  the 
           equivalent mnemonic  and  operands  for  the  memory  in  the 
           specified locations.  

      BR <address> ;<count> <CR>                            "BReakpoint"

           This  command  allows  you  to insert breakpoints to halt the 
           execution and return the user to  the  TUTOR  prompt.  Up  to 
           eight breakpoints can be entered (they  MUST  be at even word

           boundaries).   By typing  in just  BR the  user  can  display 
           all active  breakpoints.  The count option allows the user to 
           specify how many times the breakpoint  should  be  passed  by 
           before it should become active and halt the execution.  

      NOBR <address...> <CR>                             "NO BReakpoint"

           This  command  clears  active  breakpoints.  If  just NOBR is 
           typed  all  breakpoints  are  cleared.   Otherwise  only  the 
           breakpoints at the specified addresses are cleared.  

      .A0 - .A7 <expression> <CR>         "Address register display/set"

           This  command  allows  the user to see or set the contents of 
           the specified register.  If no expression is included in  the 
           command  line  the  contents  are  displayed.  Otherwise  the 
           specified register is set to the value of the expression. The 
           expression should be entered in hexidecimal format.  

           EX: .A0 will display the contents  of  address  register  A0,  
           and .A1 45 will set register A1 to 00000045 (hexidecimal).

      .D0 - .D7 <expression> <CR>            "Data register display/set"
      .PC <expression> <CR>                "Program Counter display/set"
      .US <expression> <CR>                     "User Stack display/set"

           All of these commands are similar to  the  commands described 
           above. The register affected is all that changes.  

      TR <count> <CR>                                            "TRace"

           This  command  causes  execution  to  begin from the location 
           pointed to by the PC in a incremental fashion for the  number 
           of  steps  specified  by  count.  If  just  TR is entered the 
           program is executed in a single step mode  from  the  current 
           location  in  the PC.  Each time the <CR> is pressed the next 
           instruction is executed.  After each instruction is executed, 
           the  contents  of  the  registers are displayed.  To exit the 
           single step mode simply enter another valid command.  

           EX:  TR 3 will execute 3 instructions from the current  value 
           of the PC.  

      GO <address> <CR>

           The  GO  command  causes  the  program  to  execute.    If no 
           address is specified,  execution proceeds  from  the  current 
           value  in the PC.  Otherwise it begins at the value specified 
           in the command line.  

           Suggestion:  

           It  is  recommended  that  a  breakpoint  be  entered  at the 
           location of an ending loop (a self branching loop) when using 
           the GO, so you will know when the program is done executing.

      TM                                             "Transparent Mode"

           This command puts the ECB into a mode where all input from
           the terminal port is passed out through the backend port to
           the remote computer (HP-UX on the 9040 for us). For all of
           this to work you need to be at 1200 bits per second.  This
           command only connects you to the PACX, where you must tell
           it that you want class 4-hp and then login on the 9040.  Be
           sure when you are all done that you logout from the 9040
           again (by entering TM again) or the next student using the
           ECB and TM may trash everything in your directories.
      
      LG <filename>                           "Log session in filename"

           This command is used after the TM command and login on the
           HP 9040 and then returning to the ECB by hitting ctrl-A.
           It tells the ECB to send all subsequent interactions to the
           9040 and store them in the given filename as a log of the
           session.  For LG to work the computer reached via TM must
	   have "ecbrec" (in this directory) in a directory reachable
	   from the users $PATH string (use set to see this).

      NOLG                            "Quit logging and close log file"

           This command (to the ECB) stops logging and closes the file
           where the log has been stored on the remote computer (making
           it safe from subsequent trash).

      PD                                         "host Port Disconnect"

           Disconnects the remote host port on the ECB.  This MAY cause
           the PACX to inform the 9040 that you have gone away, but it
           doesn't always work.  I suggest you use TM and logout then 
           hit ctrl-A and do this command to be sure.   

      PS                                                "Print Status"

           Prints out remote host port status on the ECB.
